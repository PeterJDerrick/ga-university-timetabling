# ga-university-timetabling
A Java project that uses a genetic algorithm to generate timetables for a university

Information for this Java project: GA University Timetabling:

This project was written by me (Peter Derrick) as my final year project at the University of the West of England (UWE) in 2017. 

It uses a steady-state genetic algorithm and data on rooms, staff and course modules to generate timetables for specific rooms, staff and student classes. Individual students are not represented here as this was too complex to implement in the time allowed, however classes in groups of twenty students are implemented.

A mathematical model was designed by my project supervisor and written in C which I then converted to Java. This was allowed as higher level mathematics of this nature is not taught on the UWE Computer Science course (in 2017).

The repository contains the Java project and code, the .csv resource files used to populate the data inside the program and my accompanying project report which was written alongside the code development. This report contains primary research (interviews with the timetabling staff and academics), secondary research (referenced academic papers), UML diagrams, requirements, acceptance tests, and design and implementation notes and diagrams.

I have recently gone back to this project, made a few corrections such as replacing absolute file paths with relative ones and done a small amount of tidying. Aside from this, the project is (as of 8th June 2018) as what was presented at the final project demonstration.
